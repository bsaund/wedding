\begin{abstract}
  We propose a novel union between Bradley Larkin Saund and Kathrn Mary Brennan\footnote{Soon to be Kathryn Mary Saund}.
  Prior marriages, such as those of our parents, provide a strong background and inspiration for us going forward.
  Our relationship over the past six years indicates many years of love to follow.
  We look to our beloved friends and family here today for support thoughout the rest of our lives.
  We predict this marriage will last till death do us part.
